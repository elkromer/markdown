## AS4 Introduction

Applicability Statement 4 is an open standard for the secure and payload-agnostic exchange of business-to-business documents using web services.  

Historically the platform of B2B transactions has moved from communication over SMTP with value-added networks to Internet-based protocols free from data transfer fees imposed by VAN operators.

The main benefits of AS4 compared to AS2 are
- compatibility with web services standards
- message pulling capabilities
- a built-in receipt mechanism

Two kinds of profiles are usually to be considered when profiling an existing standard
- **Conformance Profiles**: The different ways a product can conform to a standard based on specific ways to implement this standard. The define a precise subset of features to be supported.
- **Usage Profiles**: How a standard should be used by a community of users in order to ensure best compatibility with business practices and interoperability.
