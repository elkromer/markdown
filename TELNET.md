TELNET Protocol

A TCP connection used to transmit data with interspersed TELNET control information. A Network Virtual Terminal is set up on each side. NVT is an imaginary device which provides a standard, network-wide, itermediate representation of a canonical terminal. Both sides set one up to eliminate the need to maintain information about each other's terminals and terminal handling conventions.

The primary goal of TELNET is the provision of a standard interfacing of terminal devices and terminal-oriented processes through the network.
