# Data Encryption Standard (DES)

A symmetric-key algorithm for the encryption of digital data that was highly influential in the advancement of modern cryptography. Criticized for small key sizes (56 bits) that can be easily brute forced.

### History

Developed in the early 1970s at IBM and submitted to the National Bureau of Standards (NBM), now called National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). In 1976, after consulting with the NSA, the NBS eventually selected a slightly modified version which was published as an official Federal Informaion Processing Standard (FIPS) in 1977 ([FIPS PUB 46-1](https://csrc.nist.gov/CSRC/media/Publications/fips/46/archive/1977-01-15/documents/NBS.FIPS.46.pdf)).
