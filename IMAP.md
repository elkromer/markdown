# Internet Mail Access Protocol (IMAP)

Allows a client to access and manipulate electronic mail messages on a server. Includes operations for creating, deleting, and renaming mailboxes, checking for new messages, permanently removing messages, setting and clearing flags, parsing, searching, and selective fetching of message attributes, texts, and portions thereof. Messages are accessed by the use of message sequence numbers or unique message identifiers.
